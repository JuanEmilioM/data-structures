# data_structures_cs
Different data structures implemented in C#

Each folder contains the necesary files in order to compile the different data structures and then create a dynamic link library (DLL). 
Additionaly, you can directly include these files in your project.

If you are only interested in using the data structures download the dll folder which contains all the DLL files obtained by compiling
the different data structures.
